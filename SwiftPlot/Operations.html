        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <p>
            The syntax of SwiftPlot is based on mathematical expressions. There's one big difference tough; "=" means "will be", instead of "equals".<br>
            The first variable in a Model Line will be assigned the result of said Line.<br>
            v = v + a * dt<br>
            the variable v will be assigned the value of v + a * dt.<br>
            Note: SwiftPlot takes math order into consideration, hence it's important to take these into account. 
        </p>
        <h2>Operations</h2>
        <p>
            SwiftPlot currently supports a limited amount of operations: Power, Multiply, Divide, Add and Substract.<br>
            Below you'll find what symbol represents what operation.<br>
            - Power: ^<br>
            - Multiply: *<br>
            - Divide: /<br>
            - Add: +<br>
            - Substract: -<br>
        </p>
