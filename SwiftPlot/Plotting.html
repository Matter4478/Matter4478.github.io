            A model in SwiftPlot is based around formula's. To make a model you'll need to have those at hand.
            In this tutorial we will be making a model of a harmonic period, the time required for a string to go up and down.
            To analyze the results of your model you can do two things: 1. plot the results into a graph and 2. see all individual values.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this step the Model Lines and Variables must already be in place. To start press "Run Model".
            First we'll see the individual results and second we will plot them into a graph. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Click on "Data Keys" and you'll be presented with the results of your model. 
            Take note that only the variables that did change will be listed more than once.
        </p>

            Next up is making one of those shiny graphs.
            By default the y-axis is set to dt. In the textfield type the variable that should be plotted in the y-axis.
            The x-axis is set to t. In the textfield type the variable that should be plotted on the x-axis.
            For the example set the y-axis to u and the x-axis to t.
            Now click "Plot" and then click on "Graph". You should now be presented with a shiny graph.

            *Sometimes the graph doesn't appear as expected. In such a case it could be that the amount of data caused an automatic lag prevention.
            To resolve this open "Show Advanced Options" and select a lower "Reduce Point Factor" or select less data points by using the sliders.*
