        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>
            A model in SwiftPlot is based around formula's. To make a model you'll need to have those at hand.
            In this tutorial we will be making a model of a harmonic period, the time required for a string to go up and down.
            These formula's need values to start with. In SwiftPlot this is done in the Variables menu.

            For this step the Model Lines must already be in place. First: press "Check Variables". Now all variables should be visible.
            Variables named to real numbers should automatically be assigned the correct value. 
            Now it's time to assign values to the remaining variables.
            Type a value in the textfield and click on the variables to which that value should be assigned.
            When all variables are assigned the correct value you can continue to Plotting.
